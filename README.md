# Readme

This is a custom component for the media_player and notify components of [Home Assistant][1].

It allows you to remotely control your enigma2 compatible satellite/cable receivers.
It also allows you to send notification using the notify component.

You must install OpenWebif from your enigma2 image.

  
# What is working:
  - Power status: on, off, standby. 
  - Loads all sources from first bouquet. (Current channel and possibility to change channels)
  - Volume regulation (mute, set, step)
  - Change channel (Selecting from source list or via Right/Left - from remote controller)
  - Change channel (using channel number)
  - Current channel and current event
  - Picon from current channel
  - Supports authentication and multiple receivers
  - Sending notifications to the box (timeout and type of message can be selected)
  - Load sources from selected bouquet (thanks to madrian)
    
# Tested with OpenWebif versions:
  - 0.2.7
  - 1.3.0

# Install:
To use the media_player custom component, place the file `enigma.py` from the folder media_player inside your folder `~/.homeassistant/custom_components/media_player` 
To use the notify custom component, place the file `enigma.py` from the folder media_player inside your folder `~/.homeassistant/custom_components/notify` 

The custom components directory is inside your Home Assistant configuration directory.

You need to install (if not yet) the BeautifoulSoup module for Pyhton.

Activate the virtual environment:
``` 
$ source bin/activate
```

Install BeautifoulSoup:
``` 
$ python3 -m pip install BeautifoulSoup4
```

# Configuration Example (for both components):
By Default will load all channels from first bouquet
``` python
media_player:
- platform: enigma
    host: 192.168.1.50
    port: 80
    name: Gigablue
    icon: mdi:satellite-variant
    timeout: 20
    username: root
    password: !secret enigma_password

notify:
- platform: enigma
    host: 192.168.1.51
    port: 80
    name: Dreambox
    timeout: 20
    icon: mdi:satellite-variant
    username: root
    password: !secret enigma_password
```

# Configuration Example 2 (using a pre-defined bouquet):
To get your bouquet references, open in your browser : http://box.ip/web/getservices


You can find your bouquet reference from as follows:

Example
	```
	1:7:1:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:FROM BOUQUET "userbouquet.favourites.tv" ORDER BY bouquet BOUQUET_NAME_HERE
	```
 
In my case, if I want to load all channels from bouquet Sky Deutschland I have to look for:
	```
	1:7:1:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:FROM BOUQUET "userbouquet.dbe1e.tv" ORDER BY bouquet Sky Deutschland
	```
 
Then copy the entire string, removing the bouquet name from the end
 
Example, where I want to load all bouques from the Sky Deutschalnd bouquet:
``` python
media_player:
- platform: enigma
    host: 192.168.1.50
    port: 80
    name: Gigablue
    icon: mdi:satellite-variant
    timeout: 20
    username: root
    password: !secret enigma_password
    bouquet: '1:7:1:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:FROM BOUQUET "userbouquet.dbe1e.tv" ORDER BY bouquet'
```
